    name: "Southern Sand Octopus",
    habitat: ["Sandy Seafloors", "Seagrass Beds", "Shallow Coastal Waters"],
    diet: "Crabs, Small Crustaceans, Mollusks.",
    lifespan: "1-2 years.",
    size: "30-50cm (arm span)",
    description: "The Southern Sand Octopus (Octopus kaurna) is a master of disguise native to the coastal waters of southern Australia. It spends much of its life buried beneath sand or hidden among seagrass, using advanced camouflage to blend seamlessly with its surroundings. Often only its eyes remain visible as it waits patiently for prey to pass by. This species is highly intelligent and known to manipulate shells and debris to build temporary shelters. Despite its stealthy lifestyle, it is an active hunter, relying on quick strikes rather than pursuit. Its behavior makes it one of the most elusive octopuses encountered by divers."

    name: "Blanket Octopus",
    habitat: ["Open Ocean", "Pelagic Waters", "Surface to Mid-Water Zones"],
    diet: "Jellyfish, Small Fish, Pelagic Crustaceans.",
    lifespan: "1-2 years.",
    size: "Up to 2m (females), males ~3cm",
    description: "The Blanket Octopus (Tremoctopus spp.) is one of the ocean's most visually dramatic and biologically extreme cephalopods. Females are enormous compared to males, trailing a large, flowing web of skin that can be unfurled like a cape when threatened. This membrane makes the animal appear far larger and more intimidating to predators. Remarkably, Blanket Octopuses have been observed ripping off tentacles from venomous siphonophores and wielding them as defensive weapons. They live entirely in the open ocean, drifting and swimming rather than hiding. Their alien appearance and rare sightings make them a legend among marine biologists."

    name: "Carnarvon Flapjack Octopus",
    habitat: ["Deep Sea", "Continental Slope", "Soft Sediment Seafloor"],
    diet: "Small Crustaceans, Polychaete Worms.",
    lifespan: "Estimated 3-5 years.",
    size: "20-30cm",
    description: "The Carnarvon Flapjack Octopus is a deep-sea species adapted to the cold, dark environments off Western Australia. Unlike shallow-water octopuses, it has a soft, flattened body and large ear-like fins used to hover gently above the seafloor. It moves slowly and deliberately, conserving energy in a food-scarce environment. This species lacks an ink sac, instead relying on stealth and low visibility to avoid predators. Its webbed arms and rounded shape give it a ghostly, almost cartoon-like appearance. Encounters are rare, making it one of the lesser-known but most visually striking octopuses."

    name: "Blue Ringed Octopus",
    habitat: ["Rocky Shores", "Tide Pools", "Sandy Bottoms", "Coral Reefs"],
    diet: "Crabs, Shrimp, Hermit Crabs, Small Sea Animals.",
    lifespan: "2-3 years.",
    size: "12-20cm",
    description: "The Blue Ringed Octopus is a small but extraordinarily dangerous species found in the coastal waters between Japan and Australia. At rest, it appears relatively plain, but when threatened it displays vivid, pulsing blue rings as a warning signal. The octopus's bite contains tetrodotoxin, a powerful neurotoxin. One bite is enough to cause paralysis or death to 23 people. Despite their potency, Blue Ringed Octopuses are shy and prefer to avoid confrontation. They rely on intelligence and camouflage to hunt and escape predators. Their striking colors and lethal reputation have made them one of the most famous octopuses in the world."
